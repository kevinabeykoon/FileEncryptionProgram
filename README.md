This program is a simple encryption/decryption program. It has 2 different modes; Text-based UI and GUI-based UI. 

## Description

This program can either function as a live encrypter where the user enters a phrase and a key. The program will instantly display the encrypted phrase.
The second function is inputting a text file and a key. The program will create a new text file containing the encrypted phrases. The inputted text file
has a unique format. The first line contains the amount of phrases in the text file that is to be encrypted or decrypted. The following lines contain each 
phrase that is to be encrypted uniquely. There are two parts per line. The first part is a key, this can be any integer from +2 billion to -2 billion. The
second part is the actual phrase itself.
